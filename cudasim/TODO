The fact that SBMLParser returns some variables is a code smell; make it return everything, and require a separate call
to initialize the appropriate solver function.

replace lots of the len() calls with the corresponding numWhatever variable

weird hang
commas in print statements of example

in generated code, add:
 - header comment explaining code was automatically generated by cudasim
 - comments explaining references to param2D(


reversible reactions

when forming strings, replace concatenation with %s

# show that example 2 works correctly for modified volumes (unlike original example)

See explanation on p.73 and example of p.116 of the SBML level 2 version 5 specification.
